*   **Unified Diff View:** The new Word, Character, and JSON diff modes are displayed in a unified format, highlighting changes inline for a more intuitive and readable comparison, similar to the style used on platforms like GitHub.
*   **Quick Access to Changelog:** You can now view the latest changelog at any time directly from the plugin's settings panel by clicking the new "View Changelog" button.
