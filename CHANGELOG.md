*   **Advanced Diffing Modes:** You can now choose how to visualize the differences between two versions of a note. In addition to the standard line-by-line comparison, you can now select:

    *   **Character Diff:** Provides the most granular view, showing individual character changes.

#### ðŸŽ¨ Improvements & UX

*   **On-the-Fly Diff Switching:** A new dropdown menu has been added to the header of the diff view (both in the side panel and in a new tab). Click the new icon (`git-commit-horizontal`) to instantly switch between Line, Word, Character, and JSON diff modes.
*   **Unified Diff View:** The new Word, Character, and JSON diff modes are displayed in a unified format, highlighting changes inline for a more intuitive and readable comparison, similar to the style used on platforms like GitHub.
