*   **Note Branching:** You can now explore different ideas and writing paths within a single note without creating duplicates.
    *   Create, manage, and switch between different "branches" of a note's history directly from the Version Control view in the right sidebar.
    *   Click the branch name (e.g., `main`) to open a menu where you can select an existing branch or create a new one.
    *   Each branch saves its own content, cursor position, and history, allowing you to experiment freely without fear of messing up your primary version.
    *   This is a power-user feature. For regular use, you can continue working on the default `main` branch with no changes to your workflow.
